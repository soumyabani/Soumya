# NOTES

## CTFd Documentation

### Technology
→ **CTFd** - Python, Flask web framework.

---

### Installation

→ Install **Docker** and **Docker Compose**.

→ Clone the CTFd repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd.git
````

→ Modify the `docker-compose.yml` file from the repository to specify a `SECRET_KEY` environment for the CTFd service.

1. Generate a `.ctfd_secret_key` file:

   ```bash
   head -c 64 /dev/urandom > .ctfd_secret_key
   ```
2. Export it as an environment variable:

   ```bash
   export SECRET_KEY=$(cat .ctfd_secret_key | base64)
   ```
3. Modify in `docker-compose.yml`:

   ```
   SECRET_KEY=${SECRET_KEY}
   ```

→ Run:

```bash
docker compose up
```

→ You should now be able to access CTFd at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/)

> The default Docker Compose configuration files do not configure SSL/TLS.

### Dependencies

1. **WSGI server** - Installed by default - runs the web application - passes response for the requests from web server.
2. **Database server** - Default CTFd will create a SQLite database - used with MySQL, MariaDB, or SQLite - not recommended with PostgreSQL - CTFd supports JSON data type.
3. **Caching server** - The preferred caching server option is Redis.

### Updation

* If using **image field** → replace with new version → `docker-compose pull` → `docker-compose up`
* If using **build field** → `git pull` → `docker-compose build` → `docker-compose up`

---

### Challenges

* **File upload** - CTFd allows users to upload files.
* **Flags** - Admins create different types of flags for each challenge.

---

### Extending CTFd

* Plugins
* Providers

---

### Management

#### 1. ctfcli

🔗 [https://github.com/CTFd/ctfcli](https://github.com/CTFd/ctfcli)

* Command line uploading of challenges.
* Provides an integration with the CTFd REST API.
* Integration with CI/CD build systems.
* Contains pre-made challenge templates.
* Every challenge generated by or processed by `ctfcli` should have a `challenge.yml` file.
* **ctfcli plugins** - additions to the command line interface.

> ⚠️ *ctfcli is still considered an alpha project and changes will happen.*

#### 2. Terraform + CTFd Provider

🔗 [https://registry.terraform.io/providers/ctfer-io/ctfd/latest/docs](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/ctfer-io/ctfd/latest/docs)
🔗 [https://github.com/ctfer-io/terraform-provider-ctfd](https://github.com/ctfer-io/terraform-provider-ctfd)

---

### Integrations

1. Custom webhooks, Slack webhooks, Discord webhooks - not available for open source.
2. **MajorLeagueCyber** - CTF Event Tracker - an official listing of CTF participants and tracking of performance between events.
3. **Crisp chat** - Chat bubble to communicate with users.

### Plugins

Plugins can do things like:

* Add new routes (pages, APIs)
* Modify existing routes
* Add new database tables
* Replace templates
* Add JavaScript or CSS files

---

#### Challenge Type Plugins

* To define own type of challenges - e.g., multi-flag challenges, creating different logic for challenges (time-based, dynamic properties).

---

#### Flag Type Plugins

* To provide more flexibility to validate different types of flags - regex, static, or with additional conditions.
